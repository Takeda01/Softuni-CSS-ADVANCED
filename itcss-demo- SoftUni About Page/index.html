          <h2>SoftUni and "Software University"</h2>
          <p>
            SoftUni is one of the largest and most respected educational
            institutions, creating professionals in the fields of software
            engineering, digital marketing and design. Today SoftUni works
            directly with more than 70 IT companies and has an active community
            of 150 000 students.
          </p>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            Founded in 2013, with its unique concept and innovative educational
            methodology, SoftUni is rapidly becoming a market leader and today
            organizes hundreds of training programs, free courses and webinars,
            events and other educational initiatives that provide quality
            education to thousands of young people in the field of IT and

          </p>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            With its foundation in 2013, SoftUni starts its first and most
            successful project - the "Software University" - a unique
            educational initiative which creates high-quality software engineers
            from scratch, achieving incredible success rate - 97% of all
            graduates successfully start their career as software engineers.
          </p>
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            "Software University" is a project of SoftUni and is not among the
            state recognized universities, because the purpose of "Software
            University" is to be their alternative, providing their students
            with everything they need to start their career!
